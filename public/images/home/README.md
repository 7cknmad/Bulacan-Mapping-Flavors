This folder contains the homepage background images used by `HomePage.tsx`.

If the canonical filenames are missing, run the script `scripts\copy-home-images.ps1` from the repository root to copy existing images into this directory (Windows PowerShell):

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\scripts\\copy-home-images.ps1

If some files are missing, add them to `public/images/` or place your preferred images directly here with the following filenames:

- barasoain-1.jpg
- fiesta-1.jpg
- market-1.jpg
- church-facade.jpg
